<h1>Qian's Namepage</h1>
<h2>1.Above </h3>

<h5>I am an anonymous shallow dream, and this is my first time coming to Github. I hope to join some organizations. Below is a brief description of my experience, please take a look!
PS. Most of my works lean towards web development and Python games (or UI library components), and I am not good at developing Scrach projects</h5>

<h2>2. Main works</h2>

<h5>You can see these following projects in my Github Project!</h5>

<h3>1. Subsist</h3>

<h4>Highlight of the game: It uses a lot of original technology and is the first in the Xueersi community (similar Python sandboxes were not available before the launch of this project). It also uses a self-made UI (graphics?) library and uses 2D Berlin noise as the map foundation. The game experience and instructions are complete, with synthesis and backpack UI functions, and meets the standards required for general sandboxes.</h5>

<h3>Version overlay: 1.3.4 y (1.3.4 under development)
  
Starting time: 2022/8</h4>



<h4>Introduction: This game is inspired by MC and Survey, combined with Myssquare's terrain generation system and various highlights. It is developed using (different from CPP or Pygame) Python terminals, with 256 * 256 * 256 033 display pixels for blocks. The pixel block size is 1 byte * 2 bytes, and the game size is 769 rows (real-time update). It has the function of inserting modules, and the archive code is displayed in a list (two-dimensional) form, In addition, it also uses the choose control and terminal function of Escape from previous large-scale works (all authored by Asami myself) to enrich the game content.

  
Continuing development direction: use the gotoxy coverage function to complete the output of excess functions, add the debug function, add the namespace function, add the furnace and command group, join the infinite world, add more biome and its generation environment is reasonable and complex, etc</h5>



<h3>2. PSUIL - A non-standard UI library</h3>


<h4>This is a special project, a non-standard library, also known as the Python Simple UI Library. It has the most project controls in the community, including most self created controls. You can go and copy pychar (local, lixus can be used) for better results</h5>



<h2>3.Next</h2>
<h4>more projects will be added, including 3D developed by He Yan</h5>
